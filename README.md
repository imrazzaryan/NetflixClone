# NetflixClone
A simple Netflix clone built using HTML and CSS, featuring a responsive UI with a homepage, banner, and movie thumbnails. The project includes hover effects, a footer with links, and a structured folder layout. To get started, clone the repository, navigate to the project folder, and open index.html in your browser. Future enhancements may include JavaScript for interactivity, user authentication, and backend integration.
